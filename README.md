# Virginia Airport Decision Support Tool

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a data analytics tool designed to analyze and visualize flight delay trends at Virginia airports. It serves as a decision support mechanism to help stakeholders understand arrival delays across different carriers and months over a 10-year period (2015–2025).

The project was developed as part of the **DASC 620 Data Project**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Environment**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries**:
* `pandas` (Data manipulation)
* `matplotlib` (Visualization)
* `seaborn` (Statistical data visualization)


## 📊 Key Features

* **Carrier Analysis**: Visualizes arrival delays (`arr_delay`) by carrier using boxplots to identify which airlines experience the most variance in schedule adherence.
* **Seasonal Trends**: Segments data by month (January–December) to uncover seasonal patterns in flight delays at ORF.
* **Descriptive Statistics**: Generates statistical summaries for delays broken down by specific months to aid in decision-making.

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Aviation and airport delay data (publicly available sources)**

* **Includes flight timings, delays, and airport-related attributes**

* **Data was cleaned and transformed before analysis**

**Note**: Some data sources may be subject to availability or licensing restrictions.Last updated 19th Feb 2026

## 📊 Analysis Highlights

* **Identification of airports with consistently higher delays**

* **Time-based delay trends (daily, monthly patterns)**

* **Insights into operational inefficiencies**

* **Visual storytelling using charts and graphs**

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/virginia-airport-tool.git

```


2. **Install Dependencies**:
Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

```


3. **Run the Analysis**:
You can run the script directly if converted to `.py`, or open the notebook in Jupyter/Colab.
```bash
python patel_pitani_hirst_dasc_620_data_project.py

```



## 📈 Visualizations

The tool generates various plots, including:

* **Arrival Delay by Carrier (2015-2025)**: A boxplot comparison of different airline carriers serving Norfolk.
